# airbnb_test_automation
Automation of tests on airbnb website using python and selenium webdriver

This project was a submission i did for a job application assignement.
The aim was testing the ability of a tester to automate certain tests on a website.

The website under test was airbnb
The tests included
* Selecting (destination, check_in and check_out dates, number of guests)
* Verifying the search results are correct as per search criteria
* Changing or adding search criteria
* Verifing new results reflect changes in criteria
* Checking the details of one search result


This was my first time working in test automation and also workign with selenium and webdriver
I managed to meet all requirements except the very last one which included interacting with a google map embedded in the webpage and fetching information from it
